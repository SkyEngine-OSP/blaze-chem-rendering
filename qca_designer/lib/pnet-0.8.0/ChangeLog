	- Improve marshaling to/from Ansi/UTF8/UTF16 strings using the pinvoke
	record and the ILPInvokeGetMarshalType function.
	- Allow extended marshaling of simple arrays for complex types and
	strings if defined USE_BYREF_MARSHALING (default is set to 0).
	- Implement handling of strings, which are embedded in structures or
	simple arrays (needed for gtk#/sample/testdnd.exe).
	- Improve recursive marshaling of arrays and structures by handling the
	IL_META_MARSHAL_DIRECT flag and the NeedMarshalValue methods.
	- Introduce handling of the IL_META_MARSHAL_CUSTOM flag with two new
	MarshalCustomToObject and MarshalObjectToCustom methods which are used
	for objects that support custom marshaling.
	- Support marshaling for the case when the methods are compiled with
	IL_JIT_THREAD_IN_SIGNATURE undefined.

	* engine/jitc_pinvoke.c, engine/jitc_call.c: Inline marshaling
	code, which embed a call to the external native method directly in

	call to a jitted function so that the exception is propagated across native
	calls.

	to the new created attribute.

	* engine/lib_gc.c: Add a separate mutex in the gc handletable to
	syncronize the access to this table instead of using the process->lock
	mutex (which caused deadlocks if finalizers are invoked).

	* cscc/c/c_const.tc: Add ILNode_GetType for CString and CWString so
	that they return UnmanagedPtr instead of String machine types.

	* cscc/csharp/cs_gather.c, codegen/cg_nodes.tc: Track the nested class
	creation order in a seperate list in each parent class definition and
	create members in the proper order.

	back to ILInt32.
	
	* support/time.c: Implemented ILGetSinceRebootTime for windows
	systems.
	
	* engine/verify.c, engine/verify_except.c: Add currentException
	declaration to top of verify method.  Verify that a IL_OP_ENDFINALLY
	occurs without a finally clause.
	
2004-05-28  Thong Nguyen <tum@veridicus.com>

	* include/engine.h: Changed ILExecInit to return an error code
	and defined some error codes.

2004-05-26  Thong Nguyen <tum@veridicus.com>

	* support/dir.c: Fix for Win32 version of ILCloseDir (return
	1 rather than 0 on success).
	
	* support/file.c: Set file mode to binary mode on calls
	to ILSysIOOpenFile if system is windows.  Windows defaults
	to text mode (unbelievable!) causing files to randomly not 
	open properly.

	* support/w32_defs.h: Include <windows.h> cause libgc
	no longer does this for us.
	
	* libgc/***: Checked libgc 6.3alpha6.

	configurestate to allow the runtime to figure out if it is
	running managed or unamnaged code.  CHECK_ABORT is used to
	check for aborts after a function call so aborts can be
	initiated at most points in a thread's life.
	
	* engine/cvm_except.c: Added cases for COP_PREFIX_START_CATCH,

	and Coder_EndCatchFinally.
	
	* engine/verify_except.c: Changed coder JSR calls to Finally
	calls.  Added EndCatchFinally call on IL_OP_LEAVE and
	IL_OP_ENDFINALLY.

	all threads including the main thread (if it isn't the finalizer
	thread) before calling finalizers so that all references on the 
	CVM stack will be removed.  On systems where a user thread
	can't be destroyed because it's shared with the finalizer thread,
	the CVM stack is cleared instead.
	Added null implementation for ILExecProcessUnload().

	doc/pnettools.texi: add pre-processor dependency options such
	as "-M", "-MD", etc to the C compiler.

	* cscc/common/cc_main.c: use "-MD file" instead of "-M -MF file";
	the GNU cpp documentation is wrong!

	define PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER without defining pthread_rwlock_t.

	* cscc/c/c_lexutils.c, cscc/c/c_grammar.y: constants of the form
	"123L" should be converted into a native integer, not int64.

	* cscc/csharp/cs_invoke.tc: make sure that "params" array matching
	is only used on the last parameter (bug #8016).

2004-03-10  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* cscc/c/c_function.c: output the parameter types for
	PInvoke-imported functions.

2004-03-07  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* image/link.c: look for "pinvoke.map" files when searching for

	cscc/c/c_lvalue.tc, cscc/c/c_oper.tc: rearrange the grammar for
	"Type::Identifier" so that it can handle more than just static
	methods; implement a better C# member resolution algorithm.

	* configure.in, cscc/Makefile.am, cscc/cpp/*: check in a copy
	of gcc's C pre-processor so that we can use it instead of the
	system cpp, which is sometimes busted too much for us to use.

	* cscc/common/cc_main.c: hook "cscc-cpp" into the "cscc" front end.

2004-02-28  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	ilalink/link_module.c, ilalink/linker.h: convert "long double"
	into "double" because "native float" doesn't work properly with
	Microsoft's CLR; use ordinary names like "libc" instead of
	"$Module$" so that non-pnet C# compilers can import C libraries.

2004-02-17  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* cscc/c/c_grammar.y (ParameterDeclaration): support parameters

	recognise C# types that are tagged with "OpenSystem.C.GlobalScope"
	as containing functions that are directly accessible from C.

2004-02-16  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* codegen/cg_decls.tc, codegen/cg_gen.c, codegen/cg_gen.h,

	within C assemblies.

	* dumpasm/dump_type.c, ilalink/link_create.c, include/il_dumpasm.h:
	dump unresolved externals using C type names rather than IL type
	names, so that the error messages make more sense to ordinary users.

	* configure.in, support/time.c: use the "tm_gmtoff" field within
	"struct tm" for the timezone offset, if present (thanks to
	Ole Guldberg Jensen <olegb@opendarwin.org>).

2004-02-13  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* cscc/c/c_coerce.c (GetCoerceRules): don't strip prefixes
	off "fromType" if it is a function pointer type; this allows
	casts of the form "function pointer to void *".

	* resgen/resgen_po.c: process "fuzzy" markers in ".po" files.

	* cscc/csharp/cs_grammar.y: rearrange the grammar to handle
	casts of the form "(X *)y" where X is an expression type.

	* codegen/cg_lvalue.tc (ILNode_DerefField): clear "tempVar"
	if performing a regular assignment, to prevent "Store" from
	pushing a "leave" value onto the stack when it shouldn't do so.

2003-12-21  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* engine/lib_marshal.c: implement "StructureToPtrInternal".

2003-07-14  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* cscc/cs_main.c, cscc/csharp/cs_grammar.y, cscc/csharp/cs_scanner.l:
	introduce a flex scanner hack to distinguish between '<' used as
	an operator and '<' used as a generic type parameter designator;
	make "-fno-generics" the default, requiring "-fgenerics" to compile
	C# code that uses generics.

	* ilasm/ilasm_grammar.y, ilasm/ilasm_output.c, ilasm/ilasm_output.h:
	modify the assembler so that it can output debug information

	* doc/unrolling.txt, engine/md_arm.h, engine/md_x86.h,
	engine/unroll_branch.c: introduce some extra instructions for
	unsigned comparisons because PPC cannot set the condition
	codes for both signed and unsigned results at the same time
	like x86 and ARM can.

	* engine/cvm.c, engine/cvm_config.h: perform manual register
	assignment for PPC (doubles the PNetMark).

	* engine/cvm_call.c, engine/cvm_dasm.c, engine/cvmc_call.c,
	engine/engine.h, engine/layout.c, engine/process.c: change the
	interface dispatch logic to use IMT's like IBM's RVM, instead
	of the itable's approach we used to have.

2003-07-12  Richard Baumann  <biochem333@nyc.rr.com>

	* engine/lib_emit.c: implement the _IL_TypeBuilder_ClrTypeAddInterface,

	engine/unroll_arith.c: unroll some 64-bit integer operations.

	* engine/lib_emit.c: fixes for 64-bit platforms; use the correct
	token value for the call to "ILClassCreate".

	* engine/unroll_ptr.c: tune short branches a little for x86
	to increase code density and hence CPU caching behaviour.

	* engine/Makefile.am, engine/md_arm.c, engine/md_x86.c:
	enable the generic unroller by default; only compile in the
	md_arm and md_x86 code for the respective platforms.

	* libffi/Makefile.am, libffi/Makefile.in: remove ffitest from
	the build because it breaks the ia64 version.

2003-07-11  Richard Baumann  <biochem333@nyc.rr.com>

	C grammar to improve error handling in the parser.

2003-07-08  Thong Nguyen  <tum@veridicus.com>

	on windows, threads go through the GC.
	
2003-07-08  Gopal.V  <gopalv82@symonds.net>
	
	* cscc/common/cc_preproc.c: Modify to ignore escape sequences in
	literal strings.
	
2003-07-08  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* engine/cvm_inline.c: use ILExecThreadCallVirtualV instead

	* support/thread.c: Fix race condition bug in ILThreadJoin
	by reordering the ILWakeupSetLimit, _ILWakeupQueueAdd and
	_ILMutexLock calls.  This race condition would cause 
	ILThreadJoin to miss a signal and deadlock.
	
	* engine/engine.h: Added "isFinalizerThread" field to ILExecThread
	so finalizer threads can be treated specially when the process
	shutsdown.
	
	* engine/heap.c: Object finalizers are now responsible for
	registering the finalizer thread with the engine.

	* engine/process.c: On process shutdown, non-finalizer threads
	(both foreground and background) are now destroyed before the
	finalization thread performs its last run.
	
	* support/hb_gc: Improve startup time by delay-creating the
	finalizer thread.  Decoupled the GC code from the engine so that
	it needs to know nothing about the execution engine.  Added more

	* cscc/csharp/cs_gather.c: Fully generate class members before
	generating nested classes.

2003-07-07  Thong Nguyen <tum@veridicus.com>
	
	* support/wakeup.c: Prevent ILWakeupWait from waiting on the

	& subsequently signalled before ILWakeupWait is called.
		
2003-07-06  Thong Nguyen <tum@veridicus.com>

	* engine/lib_thread.c: Fixed monitor locking mismatch bug under
	Linux.

	* cscc/Makefile.am, ilranlib/Makefile.am, ilsize/Makefile.am,
	ilstrip/Makefile.am: add some symlinks to make the IL tools
	look like a cross-compile toolchain with the prefix "cli-unknown".

	* configure.in, ilranlib/Makefile.am: locate the system version
	of "ar" and link it as "cli-unknown-ar".

2003-07-05  Thong Nguyen  <tum@veridicus.com>

	& Reset.  Fix for resource leak that occurs when threads are
	collected without ever starting.
	
	* engine/engine.h, engine/thread.c: Renamed a few fields to be
	more consistant.
	
	* support/thread.c: Changed ILThreads so that the underlying OS
	thread is not created until start is called.  ILThreadRun now 
	starts immediately rather than suspending until start is called.
	
	* libgc/win32_threads.c:  Changed MAX_THREADS to 1024.
	
	* engine/process.c, engine/thread.c, support/hb_gc.c,
	support/thread.c: Moved background threads support down to
	the "ILThread" level rather than the "ILExecThread" level.
	
	* libgc/win32_threads.c, libgc/configure.in, libgc/include/gc.h:
	Fix so that GC_CreateThread gets registered with the GC even if
	libgc is compiled under cygwin.
	
	* docs/libgc_changes.txt: Documents changes made to libgc.
	
2003-07-05  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* cscc/csharp/cs_gather.c, image/member.c, include/il_program.h:
	search for the "virtual" method corresponding to an "override"
	and report a bug if one isn't present (Bug #4196); property
	signatures should never use the "hasthis" flag, as it is stored
	on the underlying accessor methods instead.

	* codegen/cg_gen.c, codegen/cg_gen.h, codegen/cg_nodemap.c,
	codegen/cg_nodemap.h, cscc/csharp/cs_cast.tc, cscc/csharp/cs_oper.tc:

	file from "a.out.exe" to "a.exe" (Win32) or "a.out" (non-Win32),
	to be consistent with gcc.

	* image/pecoff_writer.c (_ILWriteFinal): move the ".ildebug"
	section to the end of the image so that it can be easily stripped.

2007-07-03  Thong Nguyen  <tum@veridicus.com>

	* support/hb_gc.c: ILGCDeinit now performs a garbage collection
	before calling the finalizers one last time.

	* doc/c_users_guide.html: update the user's guide for the C
	compiler to describe the latest conventions.

	* ilheader/ilheader.c: modify the "ilheader" program so
	that it only outputs the type definitions, because the
	methods, fields, etc, can be accessed via other means.

	* cscc/c/c_grammar.y, cscc/c/c_scanner.l: remove the "__invoke__"
	keyword from the C compiler, because it is no longer required.

2003-06-29  Thong Nguyen  <tum@veridicus.com>

	* configure.in: Made gcc threading model detected occur only if
	the system isn't windows or linux (windows and linux have default
	forced threading models).
	
	* engine/layout.c: Fixed bug so that classes that don't implement
	interfaces nor have static fields are properly identified as
	managed or unmanaged.  

	* engine/method_cache.c: work around compilers that don't allow
	arithmetic on void * pointers.

	* support/thr_choose.h: make sure that CreateThread is redirected

	the current thread.

2003-06-28  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* configure.in: add "mingw" to the set of detected platforms
	for Win32 threading support.

	* engine/cvm_ptr.c, engine/engine.h, engine/heap.c, engine/layout.c:
	use "_ILEngineAllocAtomic" to allocate objects that don't have any
	GC'able fields, to prevent the GC from scanning the large static
	data areas in C applications, which rarely include managed types.

	* cscc/c/c_grammar.y: recognise "__const__" as an attribute name,
	to compile code that uses glibc headers.

	* cscc/c/c_types.c: clone bit-field declarations when a struct
	type is cloned.

	* cscc/c/c_declspec.h, cscc/c/c_grammar.y: inhibit the "useless
	keyword" warning for anonymous enumerations.

	* ilalink/link_main.c: strip multiple "/" characters from the end

	to array size computation - handle nested structs within structs, etc.

	* cscc/c/c_ainit.tc, cscc/c/c_defs.tc, cscc/c/c_grammar.y,
	cscc/c/c_oper.tc: rearrange the array initialization code so that
	all code generation and semantic analysis is in "c_ainit.tc".

	ilalink/link_class.c, ilalink/link_init.c: force the ".init"
	function to be called when a C library is used from a C#
	application which doesn't use the crt0 process.

	* doc/c_language_abi.html: update the ABI specification for the
	C compiler to match the latest changes.

	* cscc/c/c_grammar.y, cscc/c/c_types.c, cscc/c/c_types.h:
	resolve anonymous enumerated types and constants to the
	underlying type because there is no way to define an

	* cscc/c/c_oper.tc (ILNode_CastType): it is always possible to
	cast to "void" in C.

	* cscc/c/c_grammar.y: permit "register" to be used in a
	formal parameter list.

	* cscc/c/c_types.c (CTypeGetElemType): preserve function pointer
	modifiers when dereferencing an array of function pointers.

	* codegen/cg_decls.tc, codegen/cg_nodes.tc, cscc/csharp/cs_decls.tc,
	cscc/csharp/cs_grammar.y, doc/c_users_guide.html: introduce some
